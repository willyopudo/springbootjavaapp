--Project Title --
A simple project to illustrate using SpringJPA and RESTful java Services.

It uses SpringJPA , Java and PostgreSQL to store user request information in a database and provide a way of retrieving them via http endpoints.
The data is also encrypted with JPA Converters to ensure security.
For integrity purposes , the encryption key is configured to be provided as a parameter or stored in the application properties file.

cd into the directory and run mvn install.
If all is well, a successful build message is displayed.
Run the project with mvn sprinb-boot:run
This should fire the project on port 8080 at localhost

--Running the Tests --
Open your browser and run a sample http request to the REST endpoint
e.g to add a new request
         localhost:8080/add?name=update&type=data_change&details=changed name from willy to wilfred
To get a list of all stored requests
  localhost:8080/findall
 

To get a specific stored request by ID
          localhost:8080/findbyid

Ivoke a health check at endpoint:
   localhost:8080/health and
   localhost:8080/metrics
